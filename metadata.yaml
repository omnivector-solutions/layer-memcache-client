summary: Memcache client layer
maintainer: James Beedy <jamesbeedy@gmail.com>
description: |
  This layer provides the reactive client layer for memcache.
  NGINX is used to create loadbalancing proxy to the memcache cluster. When new
  memcache members are added to the cluster, this charm will re-render the memcache
  lb-proxy config with the current hosts in the cluster and reload NGINX.

  This means you can point your application config at "http://127.0.0.1:11211" and this layer will
  do the rest.
